Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

In [1]: import os

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv( 'OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI (model="gpt-40-mini")

def get_completion(prompt) :
"""Helper function to get model completion."

Vague Instruction Output:

Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in global tempera
tures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural ph
enomenon, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, defo
restation, and industrial processes, have accelerated this process since t
he late 19th century. This has led to increased greenhouse gas emissions,
primarily carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere.

Consequences of climate change include rising global temperatures, melting
ice caps, sea-level rise, more frequent and severe weather events (like hu
rricanes and droughts), and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Ad
dressing climate change requires global cooperation to reduce greenhouse g
as emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and promote sustaina
ble practices.

Clear Instruction Output:
*kPrimary Causes of Climate Change: *x

1. *kGreenhouse Gas Emissions:** The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oi
1, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contribut
or, releasing carbon dioxide (C02) and methane (CH4).

2. **Deforestation:** Trees absorb C02, and large-scale deforestation redu
ces this capacity, while also releasing stored carbon.

3. **kAgricultural Practices:**« Livestock production and certain agricultur
al methods contribute significant greenhouse gases, particularly methane a
nd nitrous oxide.

4. *kIndustrial Processes:**x Manufacturing and chemical processes release
various greenhouse gases and pollutants.

*kEffects of Climate Change: x

1. **Temperature Rise:** Global temperatures have increased, leading to mo
re frequent and severe heatwaves.

2. *kExtreme Weather Events:** Increased intensity and frequency of hurric
anes, floods, droughts, and wildfires are observed.

3. **kSea Level Rise:** Melting ice caps and glaciers, along with thermal e
xpansion of water, contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal co
mmunities.

4. **kEcosystem Disruption:** Altered habitats lead to shifts in biodiversi
ty, threatening species extinction and disrupting food webs.

5. **kPublic Health Risks:** Increased heat and pollution levels can exacer
bate health issues, while changing climates can also affect the spread of
diseases.

The scientific consensus emphasizes that urgent action is needed to mitiga
te these causes and adapt to the impacts of climate change to ensure a sus
tainable future.

Effective Instruction Structures

Now, let's explore different structures for instructions to see how they affect the
model's output.

### Photosynthesis

**kDe Finition:**

Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which green plants, algae, an
d some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical
energy in the form of glucose, using carbon dioxide and water.

*kMain Components Involved: x

*kLight Energy** (usually sunlight)
*kChlLorophyll*k (pigment in chloroplasts)
*kWater (H20)*«

*kCarbon Dioxide (CO2)*«*

*kGLucose (C6H1206)*x

*kOxygen (02 )**

OmnPWNFR

*kSteps of Photosynthesis: «x

1. *kLight Absorption:** Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, primarily in the bl
ue and red wavelengths.

2. *kWater Splitting (Photolysis):**k The absorbed light energy splits wate
r molecules into oxygen, protons, and electrons.

3. **Oxygen Release:** Oxygen is released as a byproduct into the atmosphe
re.

4. **kEnergy Conversion:** The electrons move through the electron transpor
t chain, creating ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide ade
nine dinucleotide phosphate) from ADP and NADP*.

5. **kCalvin Cycle:** In the stroma, ATP and NADPH are used to convert carb
on dioxide into glucose through a series of reactions.

*kImportance for Life on Earth:*x

Photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth as it produces oxygen, which i
s essential for the respiration of most living organisms. Additionally, it
forms the base of the food chain, providing energy and organic compounds f
or plants, animals, and humans.

Narrative Structure Output:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacte
ria convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose, usin
g carbon dioxide and water.

Here's how it works, step-by-step:

1. *kLight Absorptionx*: Plants have a green pigment called chlorophyll, p
rimarily found in chloroplasts, that captures sunlight. This light energy
In [6]:

is essential for driving the photosynthesis process.

2. *&kWater Uptakexx: Roots absorb water (H20) from the soil and transport
it to the leaves through specialized vessels known as xylem.

3. **kCarbon Dioxide Intakex*k: Plants take in carbon dioxide (C02) from the
atmosphere through small openings in their leaves called stomata.

4. **kLight Reaction**: In the chloroplasts, the absorbed light energy spli
ts water molecules into oxygen (02), protons, and electrons. This reaction
releases oxygen as a byproduct, which is expelled into the atmosphere.

5. **kCalvin Cyclex*: The electrons and energy produced in the light reacti
on are used in the Calvin Cycle to convert carbon dioxide and protons into
glucose (Cc6Hi206), a simple sugar that serves as an energy source for the
plant.

In summary, photosynthesis is crucial for life on Earth because it produce
s oxygen, which is vital for the survival of most living organisms, and it
forms the base of the food chain by converting solar energy into a form th
at can be used by other organisms for energy. Without photosynthesis, life
as we know it would not exist.
