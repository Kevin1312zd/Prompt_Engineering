print(11m. invoke(prompt) .content)
print("-" « 5Q)

Prompt 1:
List 3 applications of AI in healthcare.

Response:
Here are three applications of AI in healthcare:

1. *kMedical Imaging and Diagnosticsxx: AI algorithms, particularly those

based on deep learning, are used to analyze medical images (such as X-ray

s, MRIs, and CT scans) to assist radiologists in diagnosing conditions lik
e tumors, fractures, and other abnormalities. These systems can enhance ac
curacy and speed in detecting diseases, often identifying issues that may

be missed by human eyes.

2. **Predictive Analytics for Patient Outcomes**: AI can analyze large dat
asets from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict patient outcomes, s
uch as the likelihood of readmission, progression of diseases, or response
to specific treatments. This application helps healthcare providers make i
nformed decisions about patient care and improve overall treatment plans.

3. *kPersonalized Medicinexx: AI is used to tailor treatment plans to indi
vidual patients by analyzing genetic information, lifestyle data, and othe
r personal health factors. This approach allows for more effective and tar
geted therapies, especially in areas like oncology, where understanding th
e genetic makeup of tumors can lead to better treatment options.

These applications demonstrate how AI is transforming healthcare by improv
ing diagnostics, enhancing patient care, and personalizing treatment.

Prompt 2:
Explain how AI is revolutionizing healthcare, with 3 specific examples.

Response:

AI is significantly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, pers
onalizing treatment, and optimizing operational efficiency. Here are three
specific examples:

1. **Diagnostic Imaging*x:

AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models, are being applied to
medical imaging to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnoses. For instan
ce, AI systems can analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans to detect anomalies
such as tumors, fractures, or other conditions with remarkable precision.
A notable example is Google's DeepMind, which developed an AI system that
can detect eye diseases from retinal scans with accuracy that matches or s
urpasses that of human experts. This capability not only speeds up the dia
gnostic process but also helps in identifying issues that may sometimes be
missed by human radiologists.

2. **Predictive Analytics for Patient Outcomesx*:

AI is being used to predict patient outcomes and identify those at risk
for complications or readmissions. For example, algorithms can analyze vas
t amounts of patient data, including medical history, lab results, and dem
ographic information, to identify patterns that indicate a higher likeliho
od of adverse events. Hospitals like Mount Sinai have implemented AI-drive
n tools that analyze electronic health records to predict which patients a
re at risk of developing conditions like sepsis. By flagging these patient
s early, healthcare providers can intervene promptly, improving outcomes a
nd potentially saving lives.

3. *kPersonalized Medicinexx:

AI is playing a crucial role in the development of personalized treatme
nt plans based on an individual’s unique genetic makeup and lifestyle fact
ors. For instance, companies like Tempus utilize AI to analyze clinical an
d molecular data to help oncologists tailor cancer treatments to individua
l patients. By processing genomic sequencing data and correlating it with
treatment outcomes, AI helps identify which therapies are likely to be mos
t effective for specific patients, thereby enhancing the efficacy of treat
ment and minimizing unnecessary side effects.

Together, these examples illustrate how AI is not only improving diagnosti
c accuracy and patient outcomes but also fostering a more personalized and
efficient healthcare system.

Prompt 3:

S:

1. **Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy**: AI-powered diagnostic tools help anal
yze medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, with remarkable pr
ecision. These systems can identify patterns and anomalies that might be o
verlooked by the human eye, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnose
s. For instance, AI algorithms can assist in detecting early signs of dise
ases like cancer, allowing for timely intervention and better patient outc
omes.

2. *kStreamlined Administrative Tasks**x: AI has automated various administ
rative processes, such as scheduling appointments, managing patient record
s, and processing insurance claims. Tools like natural language processing
(NLP) enable voice recognition for clinical documentation, reducing the ti
me spent on paperwork. This efficiency allows me to focus more on patient

care rather than administrative burdens, ultimately improving the overall

patient experience.

3. *kPersonalized Treatment Plansx*x: AI analyzes vast amounts of patient d
ata, including genetic information, treatment history, and lifestyle facto
rs, to help create personalized treatment plans. By leveraging predictive
analytics, AI can identify the most effective interventions for individual
patients, considering their unique circumstances. This tailored approach n
ot only enhances the effectiveness of treatments but also fosters better p
atient engagement and adherence to medical advice.

Reducing biases and improving fairness in Al outputs

Let's explore how prompt engineering can help in overcoming some limitations of
language models:

In [13]: fact_check_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["statement"'] ,

template="""Evaluate the following statement for factual accuracy. I
Statement: {statement}

Evaluation:"""

)

chain = fact_check_prompt | llm
print(chain.invoke("The capital of France is London.") .content)

Evaluation: The statement is incorrect. The capital of France is Paris, no
t London.

Improving Complex Problem-Solving

Prompt engineering can also help in breaking down complex problems and guiding
the model through a step-by-step reasoning process:

Tn [14]: problem_solving_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["problem'"] ,
template="""Solve the following problem step by step:
Problem: {problem}
Solution:
qjuuu
)

chain = problem_solving_prompt | llm
print(chain.invoke("Calculate the compound interest on $10@@ invested fo

To calculate the compound interest on an investment, we can use the formul
a for compound interest:

\l

A = P(1 + r/n)*{nt}

\]

Where:

- \( A \) = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including inter
est.

- \( P \) = the principal amount (the initial amount of money).

- \( r \) = annual interest rate (decimal).

- \( n \) = number of times that interest is compounded per year.

- \( t \) = the number of years the money is invested or borrowed.
In this problem:

- \( P = 1000 \) (the principal amount)

- \( r = @.@5 \) (5% annual interest rate expressed as a decimal)
-\( n = 1 \) (interest is compounded annually)

- \( t = 5 \) (the number of years)

Now, we will calculate step by step:

### Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula

\l
A = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{@.05}{1}\right)*{1 \times 5}

\l

### Step 2: Simplify the expression inside the parentheses

\l

A = 1000 \left(1 + @.0@5\right)*{5}
\]

\l

A = 1000 \left(1.05\right)*{5}

\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( (1.05)*{5} \)

Using a calculator or by manual computation:

\l
(1.05)*{5} \approx 1.2762815625

\]
### Step 4: Multiply by the principal amount

Now, we substitute back to find \( A \):

\l
A = 100@ \times 1.2762815625 \approx 1276.28

\]
### Step 5: Calculate the compound interest

The compound interest can be found by subtracting the principal from the t
otal amount:

\l
