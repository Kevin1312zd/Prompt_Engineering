Setup
First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.
In [2]:

import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import random
from collections import Counter
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

Generating Multiple Reasoning Paths
Let's create a function that generates multiple reasoning paths for a given problem.

In [7]:

def generate_multiple_paths(problem, num_paths=3):
"""
Generate multiple reasoning paths for a given problem.
Args:
problem (str): The problem statement.
num_paths (int): Number of reasoning paths to generate.

Returns:
list: A list of generated reasoning paths.
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["problem", "path_number"],
template="""Solve the following problem using a unique approach. This i
Problem: {problem}
Reasoning path {path_number}:"""
)
paths = []
for i in range(num_paths):
chain = prompt_template | llm
response = chain.invoke({"problem": problem, "path_number": i+1})
paths.append(response)
return paths

Now, let's test our function with a sample problem.
In [11]:

problem = "A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. How hig
paths = generate_multiple_paths(problem)
for i, path in enumerate(paths, 1):
print(f"Path {i}:\n{path}\n")
Path 1:
To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with a
n initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics, par
ticularly the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravi
ty.
### Reasoning Path 1:
1. **Identify the Variables:**
- Initial velocity (\(v_0\)) = 20 m/s (upward)
- Final velocity (\(v\)) at the highest point = 0 m/s (the ball stops r
ising at the peak)
- Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = -9.81 m/s² (negative because it
acts downward)
2. **Use the Kinematic Equation:**
We can use the following kinematic equation that relates initial veloci
ty, final velocity, acceleration, and displacement (height in this case):
\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a s
\]

Here, \(s\) is the maximum height, \(v_0\) is the initial velocity, \(v
\) is the final velocity, and \(a\) is the acceleration. Plugging in the v
alues we have:
\[
0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)s
\]
3. **Rearranging the Equation:**
Rearranging this equation to solve for \(s\):
\[
0 = 400 - 19.62s
\]
\[
19.62s = 400
\]
\[
s = \frac{400}{19.62}
\]
4. **Calculate the Height:**
Performing the calculation:
\[
s \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
\]
### Conclusion:
The maximum height the ball will reach when thrown upwards with an initial
velocity of 20 m/s is approximately **20.39 meters**.
Path 2:
To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with a
n initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics, spe
cifically focusing on the concepts of initial velocity, acceleration due t
o gravity, and the point at which the ball reaches its maximum height.
### Step 1: Understand the situation
When the ball is thrown upwards, it will eventually slow down due to the f
orce of gravity acting against its motion. The acceleration due to gravity
(g) is approximately -9.81 m/s² (the negative sign indicates that gravity
acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the ball).
### Step 2: Use the kinematic equation
We can use the following kinematic equation to find the maximum height (h)
reached by the ball:
\[
v^2 = u^2 + 2a s
\]
Where:
- \( v \) = final velocity at the maximum height (0 m/s, since the ball st
ops rising at that point)
- \( u \) = initial velocity (20 m/s)
- \( a \) = acceleration (which is -9.81 m/s²)
- \( s \) = displacement (maximum height, h)

### Step 3: Set up the equation
At the maximum height, the final velocity \( v \) is 0. Plugging in the va
lues, we get:
\[
0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)h
\]
### Step 4: Simplify and solve for h
This simplifies to:
\[
0 = 400 - 19.62h
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
19.62h = 400
\]
Now, divide both sides by 19.62:
\[
h = \frac{400}{19.62} \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
\]
### Conclusion
The maximum height the ball will reach is approximately **20.39 meters**.
This unique approach clearly outlines the use of kinematic equations to de
rive the height based on initial conditions and the effects of gravity.
Path 3:
To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with a
n initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics and
energy conservation. Here, we'll use energy conservation as our unique app
roach.
### Step 1: Understanding the Energy Conservation Principle
When the ball is thrown upwards, it has kinetic energy due to its initial
velocity. As it rises, this kinetic energy is converted into gravitational
potential energy until it reaches its maximum height, where its velocity b
ecomes zero.
### Step 2: Formulating the Energy Equation
The kinetic energy (KE) at the moment the ball is thrown can be expressed
as:
\[
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]
where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the ball,
- \( v \) is the initial velocity (20 m/s).
The gravitational potential energy (PE) at the maximum height can be expre
ssed as:

\[
PE = mgh
\]
where:
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \te
xt{m/s}^2 \)),
- \( h \) is the maximum height reached.
### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
At the maximum height, all the kinetic energy will be converted into poten
tial energy:
\[
\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh
\]
Notice that the mass \( m \) can be canceled from both sides of the equati
on:
\[
\frac{1}{2}v^2 = gh
\]
### Step 4: Solving for Maximum Height
Now we can rearrange the equation to solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}v^2}{g}
\]
### Step 5: Plugging in the Values
Substituting \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2
\):
\[
h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}(20)^2}{9.81}
\]
\[
h = \frac{200}{9.81}
\]
\[
h \approx 20.39 \, \text{m}
\]
### Conclusion
The maximum height the ball will reach is approximately **20.39 meters**.
This method effectively utilizes energy conservation principles, providing
a unique approach to solving the problem.

Aggregating Results
Now that we have multiple reasoning paths, let's create a function to aggregate the
results and determine the most consistent answer.

In [12]:

def aggregate_results(paths):
"""
Aggregate results from multiple reasoning paths.
Args:
paths (list): List of reasoning paths.

Returns:
str: The most consistent answer.
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["paths"],
template="""Analyze the following reasoning paths and determine the mos
Reasoning paths:
{paths}
Most consistent answer:"""
)
chain = prompt_template | llm
response = chain.invoke({"paths": "\n".join(paths)}).content
return response

Let's apply this aggregation function to our previous results.
In [13]:

aggregated_result = aggregate_results(paths)
print("Aggregated Result:\n", aggregated_result)
Aggregated Result:
The most consistent answer across all reasoning paths is that the maximum
height the ball will reach when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of
20 m/s is approximately **20.39 meters**.
### Analysis of Reasoning Paths:
1. **Reasoning Path 1 and Path 2 (Kinematic Equations)**:
- Both paths correctly identify the necessary variables and apply the k
inematic equation \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a s \). They both arrive at the same c
onclusion through proper rearrangement and calculation.
- The calculations performed in both paths are consistent, leading to t
he same result of 20.39 meters.
2. **Reasoning Path 3 (Energy Conservation)**:
- This path uses a different approach by leveraging the conservation of
energy. It starts with kinetic energy and equates it to potential energy a
t the maximum height.
- The final result of 20.39 meters is consistent with the previous path
s, confirming that the calculation is valid regardless of the method used.
### Conclusion:
Since all reasoning paths lead to the same calculated height of approximat
ely **20.39 meters**, there are no discrepancies among them. The use of di
fferent methods (kinematic equations and energy conservation) corroborates
the correctness of the result, making it robust and reliable. Thus, the mo
st likely correct answer is indeed **20.39 meters**.

Self-Consistency Check

To further improve our results, let's implement a self-consistency check that
evaluates the reliability of our aggregated answer.
In [14]:

def self_consistency_check(problem, aggregated_result):
"""
Perform a self-consistency check on the aggregated result.
Args:
problem (str): The original problem statement.
aggregated_result (str): The aggregated result to check.

Returns:
str: An evaluation of the result's consistency and reliability.
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["problem", "result"],
template="""Evaluate the consistency and reliability of the following r
Problem: {problem}
Result: {result}

Evaluation (consider factors like logical consistency, adherence to kno
)
chain = prompt_template | llm
response = chain.invoke({"problem": problem, "result": aggregated_result
return response

Now, let's apply the self-consistency check to our aggregated result.
In [15]:

consistency_evaluation = self_consistency_check(problem, aggregated_result)
print("Self-Consistency Evaluation:\n", consistency_evaluation)
Self-Consistency Evaluation:
### Evaluation of Consistency and Reliability
1. **Logical Consistency**:
- The reasoning paths presented are logically consistent in their appro
ach to solving the problem. Both kinematic equations and energy conservati
on principles are valid methods for determining the maximum height of a pr
ojectile. The fact that all paths arrive at the same numerical result rein
forces the logical soundness of the conclusion.
2. **Adherence to Known Facts**:
- The use of the kinematic equation \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as \) and the pri
nciple of energy conservation (where kinetic energy at the initial height
is converted to potential energy at the maximum height) are both grounded
in classical mechanics. The initial velocity of 20 m/s and acceleration du
e to gravity (approximately -9.81 m/s²) are standard parameters used in pr
ojectile motion problems. The calculations are therefore based on known ph
ysical laws and principles.
3. **Calculation Accuracy**:
- It is important to verify the calculations that lead to the conclusio
n of 20.39 meters. Using the kinematic equation:
\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as
\]

where:
- \( v \) (final velocity at the peak) = 0 m/s,
- \( v_0 \) (initial velocity) = 20 m/s,
- \( a \) (acceleration due to gravity) = -9.81 m/s²,
- \( s \) (displacement or maximum height) is what we want to find.
Rearranging gives:
\[
0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)s
\]
\[
0 = 400 - 19.62s
\]
\[
19.62s = 400 \Rightarrow s = \frac{400}{19.62} \approx 20.39 \text{ m
eters}
\]
- Similarly, applying energy conservation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = mgh
\]
where \( m \) cancels out, confirms:
\[
20^2 = 2gh \Rightarrow h = \frac{20^2}{2 \cdot 9.81} \approx 20.39 \t
ext{ meters}
\]
4. **Potential Biases**:
- There appears to be no bias in the reasoning paths, as both methods i
ndependently yield the same result. The analysis does not favor one method
over the other, ensuring that the conclusion is drawn fairly from multiple
approaches.
### Conclusion:
The result of approximately **20.39 meters** is consistent and reliable ba
sed on the analysis provided. The calculations adhere to established physi
cal laws, and the use of different reasoning paths yields the same outcom
e, reinforcing the accuracy of the conclusion. Therefore, the evaluation c
onfirms that the result can be accepted with confidence.

Applying to Different Problem Types
Let's demonstrate how this approach can be applied to different types of problems.
In [16]:

# Example problems
problems = [
"What is the capital of France?",
"Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.",
"If a train travels at 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover 180 km?"
]
for problem in problems:
print(f"Problem: {problem}")
result, evaluation = solve_problem(problem)
print("Aggregated Result:\n", result)
print("\nConsistency Evaluation:\n", evaluation)
print("\n" + "-"*50 + "\n")
Problem: What is the capital of France?
Aggregated Result:
The most consistent answer across all three reasoning paths is that the c
apital of France is **Paris**.
### Explanation of Consistency:
1. **Identification of the Country**: All reasoning paths correctly identi
fy France as the country in question.
2. **Cultural and Historical Significance**: Each path emphasizes the cult
ural, historical, and political importance of Paris, which is consistent w
ith its designation as the capital.
3. **Political Center**: The mention of key political institutions and the
central role of Paris in the governance of France is present in all paths.
4. **Common Knowledge**: Each reasoning path acknowledges that Paris is wi
dely recognized as the capital, reinforcing the answer through common educ
ational knowledge.
### Conclusion:
Due to the alignment in identifying Paris as the capital based on cultura
l, historical, and political significance, as well as its recognition in c
ommon knowledge, the most likely correct answer is indeed **Paris**. There
are no discrepancies in the reasoning paths that would suggest an alternat
ive answer.

The evaluation of the provided result regarding the capital of France, wh
ich is identified as Paris, demonstrates strong consistency and reliabilit
y based on several factors. Here’s a detailed assessment:
### 1. **Logical Consistency**
- Each reasoning path aligns logically with the question posed. The identi
fication of France as the country and Paris as its capital is coherent and
follows a rational framework. There are no contradictions in the reasoning
processes, which enhances the overall reliability of the conclusion.
### 2. **Adherence to Known Facts**
- The answer explicitly states that Paris is the capital of France, which
is a well-established fact recognized internationally. This aligns with hi
storical, political, and cultural knowledge, making the conclusion factual
ly accurate. The reinforcement of this fact across multiple reasoning path
s further solidifies its validity.
### 3. **Cultural and Historical Context**
- The emphasis on Paris’s cultural, historical, and political significance

is pertinent. Not only is Paris the administrative center of France, but i
t also has a rich heritage that contributes to its status as the capital.
This contextualization strengthens the answer and demonstrates a comprehen
sive understanding of the subject matter.
### 4. **Common Knowledge and Consensus**
- The recognition of Paris as the capital of France is pervasive in educat
ion and general knowledge. The reasoning paths acknowledge this common und
erstanding, which adds another layer of reliability to the conclusion. Con
sensus on such fundamental knowledge indicates a low probability of error.
### 5. **Absence of Bias**
- The reasoning paths seem objective and free from biases that might skew
the answer. They focus on factual information rather than subjective inter
pretations, which enhances the credibility of the result.
### Conclusion
Overall, the evaluation shows that the result of identifying Paris as the
capital of France is highly consistent and reliable. The logical structure
of the reasoning, adherence to well-known facts, incorporation of relevant
cultural and historical context, and absence of bias all contribute to a r
obust conclusion. Therefore, it can be confidently asserted that the capit
al of France is indeed **Paris**.
-------------------------------------------------Problem: Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.
Aggregated Result:
The most consistent answer is that all three reasoning paths illustrate t
he fundamental concepts of supply and demand in economics through storytel
ling, but they each present slightly different scenarios that reinforce th
e same principles.
### Analysis of Reasoning Paths
1. **Reasoning Path 1** focuses on a bakery scenario, using the relationsh
ip between the price of bread and how it affects consumer demand and the b
aker's supply. It explains the concepts of supply, demand, market equilibr
ium, and how changes in price impact both sides.
2. **Reasoning Path 2** introduces Sally's lemonade stand in Econoville, s
howcasing a similar dynamic where the price of lemonade affects how much c
onsumers are willing to buy and how much Sally is willing to supply. It il
lustrates the same concepts of supply and demand with a different product
and market condition, including shifts in demand due to external factors l
ike weather.
3. **Reasoning Path 3** tells the story of Lucy in a market garden, where
the effects of a bountiful harvest and a drought directly influence supply
and demand. This narrative also captures the essence of market equilibrium
and how external conditions can shift supply and demand.
### Consistency and Discrepancies
The main consistency across all three paths is the demonstration of the ba
sic economic principles:
- **Supply** (the quantity of goods producers are willing to sell at vario
us prices)
- **Demand** (the quantity of goods consumers are willing to buy at variou
s prices)
- **Market Equilibrium** (where supply equals demand at a certain price)

Each path uses a relatable story to express these concepts, making them ac
cessible and understandable. While there are different products (bread, le
monade, vegetables) and scenarios (price changes, weather effects), they a
ll effectively illustrate the same underlying economic principles.
### Conclusion
The most likely correct answer is that supply and demand are interdependen
t forces in the marketplace, as illustrated through these narratives. The
stories effectively demonstrate how price fluctuations affect both supply
and demand, leading to market equilibrium. The consistent theme is the rel
ationship between what producers are willing to sell and what consumers ar
e willing to buy, making the economic principles clear through relatable e
xamples.
Consistency Evaluation:
The evaluation of the provided result regarding the concept of supply and
demand in economics reveals several strengths and some areas for considera
tion in terms of consistency and reliability.
### Strengths:
1. **Logical Consistency**: The reasoning paths consistently illustrate th
e fundamental economic principles of supply and demand. Each scenario is f
ramed within the context of how price influences both consumer demand and
producer supply, adhering to the basic tenets of microeconomics.
2. **Adherence to Known Facts**: The examples provided (a bakery, a lemona
de stand, and a market garden) are all grounded in real-world situations t
hat can be easily understood by a wide audience. They accurately depict ho
w external factors (price changes, weather conditions) can shift supply an
d demand, which aligns with established economic theories.
3. **Clarity of Explanation**: The use of storytelling makes the concepts
of supply and demand accessible and relatable. Each path effectively commu
nicates the relationship between price, supply, and demand, which is essen
tial for understanding market dynamics.
4. **Illustration of Market Equilibrium**: The consistent mention of marke
t equilibrium across all scenarios reinforces the importance of this conce
pt in economics. It demonstrates how supply and demand interact to determi
ne prices in a market.
### Areas for Consideration:
1. **Potential Bias in Scenarios**: While all paths are valid, the relianc
e on common scenarios (like lemonade stands and bakeries) may overlook mor
e complex market dynamics that can exist in real economies. For a comprehe
nsive understanding, it could be beneficial to include examples from vario
us industries or more complex market situations (e.g., monopolies, oligopo
lies, or global markets).
2. **Simplification of Economic Dynamics**: The scenarios presented might
simplify some of the complexities of supply and demand. For example, they
do not address factors such as consumer preferences, the impact of adverti
sing, or the role of government policies in influencing supply and demand,
which are also crucial to a full understanding of these concepts.
3. **Assumption of Rational Behavior**: The narratives appear to assume th
at consumers and producers act rationally, which is a common assumption in

economic models. However, actual consumer behavior can be influenced by ir
rational factors, emotions, or social influences. Highlighting these aspec
ts could provide a more nuanced understanding of the supply and demand fra
mework.
### Conclusion:
Overall, the result provided is consistent and reliable in explaining the
concept of supply and demand in economics. It effectively utilizes relatab
le scenarios to illustrate fundamental principles while maintaining logica
l coherence. However, to enhance the evaluation, it would be beneficial to
consider more diverse and complex examples, address potential biases, and
acknowledge the limitations of the rational actor model. This would lead t
o a more comprehensive understanding of supply and demand in real-world ec
onomics.
-------------------------------------------------Problem: If a train travels at 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover 180
km?
Aggregated Result:
The most consistent answer across the three reasoning paths is that it wi
ll take the train **3 hours** to cover 180 km at a speed of 60 km/h.
### Explanation of Consistency:
1. **Formula Used**: All three reasoning paths rely on the same fundamenta
l relationship between distance, speed, and time, represented by the formu
la:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
This consistency in the formula ensures that the basis of the calculati
ons is the same across all paths.
2. **Substitution of Values**: Each path correctly identifies the distance
as 180 km and the speed as 60 km/h, and correctly substitutes these values
into the formula.
3. **Calculation**: Each reasoning path performs the division in the same
manner, leading to the same result:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]
4. **Conclusion**: Each reasoning path arrives at the same conclusion, aff
irming that the time required for the train to travel the specified distan
ce at the given speed is indeed 3 hours.
### Summary:
There are no discrepancies in any of the reasoning paths. They all correct
ly apply the distance-speed-time relationship and arrive at the same concl
usion. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is **3 hours**.
Consistency Evaluation:
The evaluation of the result regarding how long it will take a train trav
eling at 60 km/h to cover 180 km can be broken down into several key facto
rs: logical consistency, adherence to known facts, and potential biases.
### Logical Consistency:
1. **Application of the Formula**: The result is based on the correct appl
ication of the distance-speed-time relationship, which is a well-establish

ed principle in physics. The formula used, \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Di
stance}}{\text{Speed}} \), is universally accepted and correctly applied h
ere.
2. **Uniform Calculations**: Each reasoning path leading to the final resu
lt uses the same mathematical operations to arrive at the conclusion. Ther
e is no indication of miscalculation or logical fallacy in any of the path
s, reinforcing the reliability of the answer.
### Adherence to Known Facts:
1. **Known Values**: The values used in the calculations—180 km as the dis
tance and 60 km/h as the speed—are reasonable and typical for train trave
l, meaning there are no factual errors in the provided data.
2. **Correct Interpretation of Units**: The reasoning correctly interprets
the units of speed (km/h) and distance (km), leading to a coherent final u
nit of time (hours).
### Potential Biases:
1. **Bias in Result Interpretation**: There does not appear to be any bias
influencing the interpretation of the result; the answer is purely based o
n mathematical calculation rather than subjective reasoning.
2. **Confirmation Bias**: If there were any external influences or pre-exi
sting beliefs about the train’s speed or distance, those could lead to con
firmation bias. However, in this case, the result is strictly based on cal
culations without any subjective input.
### Summary:
The evaluation of the reasoning paths shows that they are logically consis
tent, adhere to known facts, and do not exhibit any identifiable biases. E
ach path arrives at the same conclusion through sound reasoning, confirmin
g that the answer of **3 hours** is both consistent and reliable. The resu
lt is robust against scrutiny, and one can confidently assert that it accu
rately reflects the time required for the train to cover 180 km at a speed
of 60 km/h.
