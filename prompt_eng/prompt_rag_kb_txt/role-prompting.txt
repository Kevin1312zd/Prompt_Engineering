By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of role prompting
techniques and how to effectively implement them using OpenAl and LangChain.
You'll be equipped with the skills to craft compelling role descriptions and leverage
them to enhance Al model performance in various applications.

Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv( 'OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI (model="gpt-40-mini")

Basic Role Assignment

Let's start with a simple example of role assignment. We'll create a prompt that
assigns the role of a technical writer to the Al model.

tech_writer_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["topic"],
template="""You are a technical writer specializing in creating clea
Your task is to write a brief explanation of {topic} for a user manu:
Please provide a 2-3 sentence explanation that is easy for non-techn

)

chain = tech_writer_prompt | llm
response = chain.invoke({"topic": "cloud computing"})
print(response.content)

Cloud computing is a technology that allows you to store and access data a
nd applications over the internet instead of your computer's hard drive. T
his means you can use software and files from anywhere, at any time, as lo
ng as you have an internet connection. It offers flexibility, scalability,
and convenience for both personal and professional use.

Crafting Effective Role Descriptions

Now, let's explore how to craft more detailed and effective role descriptions. We'll
create a prompt for a financial advisor role with a more comprehensive description.
In [4]:

financial_advisor_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["client_situation"],
template="""You are a seasoned financial advisor with over 20 years |
You have a track record of helping clients from diverse backgrounds
Your approach is characterized by:
1. Thorough analysis of each client's unique financial situation
2. Clear and jargon-free communication of complex financial concepts
3. Ethical considerations in all recommendations
4. A focus on long-term financial health and stability

Given the following client situation, provide a brief (3-4 sentences

Given your solid income and savings, the first step is to establish a reti
rement plan. Consider contributing to a tax-advantaged retirement account,
like a 4@1(k) or an IRA, to take advantage of compounding interest and pot
ential employer match. Additionally, aim to build an emergency fund coveri
ng 3-6 months of living expenses to enhance your financial stability. Last
ly, regularly review and adjust your investment strategy to align with you
r long-term financial goals, ensuring a balanced approach to risk and grow

Comparing Responses with Different Roles

To demonstrate how different roles can affect the Al's responses, let's create
prompts for three different roles and compare their outputs on the same topic

roles = [
("Scientist", "You are a research scientist specializing in climate
("Teacher", "You are a middle school science teacher. Explain the fo
("Journalist", "You are a journalist writing for a popular science m

]
topic = "The greenhouse effect"

for role, description in roles:

role_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["topic"],
template=f''{description} {{topic}}"

)

chain = role_prompt | 1lm

response = chain. invoke({"topic": topic})

print(f'"\n{role}'s explanation: \n")

print(response.content)

Scientist's explanation:

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface.
It occurs when the Sun’s energy reaches the Earth’s atmosphere — some of t
his energy is reflected back to space and the rest is absorbed and re-radi
ated by greenhouse gases.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

1. **Solar Radiation**: The Sun emits energy in the form of solar radiatio
n, which includes visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiatio

n. When this energy reaches Earth, about 30% is reflected back into space

by clouds, atmospheric particles, and reflective surfaces (like ice and sn
ow). The remaining 70% is absorbed by the Earth's surface (land and ocean

s), which warms the surface.

2. **Re-radiation of Heat*x*x: The Earth, having absorbed solar energy, warm
s up and subsequently emits energy back into the atmosphere in the form of
infrared radiation (heat). This is a crucial step as it transforms solar e
nergy into thermal energy.

3. *kGreenhouse Gases**k: Certain gases in the atmosphere, known as greenho
use gases (GHGs), trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation. The most s
ignificant greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (C02), methane (CHa), n
itrous oxide (N20), and water vapor (H20). These gases have molecular stru
ctures that allow them to absorb and re-radiate infrared radiation, effect
ively trapping heat within the atmosphere.

4. *kEnhanced Greenhouse Effectx*x: While the greenhouse effect is a natura
Ll and essential process that maintains Earth's temperature at a level cond
ucive to life, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels,
deforestation, and industrial processes, have led to an increase in the co
ncentration of greenhouse gases. This enhanced greenhouse effect results i
n more heat being retained in the atmosphere, leading to global warming an
d climate change.

5. **kClimate Impacts**: The increase in average global temperatures affect
s climate systems, leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea leve
ls, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity.

In summary, the greenhouse effect is a fundamental component of the Earth’
s climate system, facilitating a habitable environment by regulating tempe
rature. However, anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gas concentrations

are intensifying this natural effect, resulting in significant environment
al changes and challenges.

Teacher's explanation:

Sure! Let’s imagine the Earth as a big greenhouse, which is a special buil
ding that helps plants grow by keeping them warm and cozy. Here's how the
greenhouse effect works:

1. **Sunshinex*: The Sun shines down on the Earth, sending light and warmt
h our way. This is like the sunlight coming into a greenhouse.

2. **Earth’s Surfacekk: When the sunlight hits the ground, buildings, and
even the ocean, it warms them up. Just like how the inside of a greenhouse
gets warm when the sun shines on it.

3. *kHeat Trapped**: Now, the Earth doesn’t just keep all that heat. Some
of it tries to escape back into space. However, there are certain gases in
our atmosphere, called greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide and methane),
that act like a blanket. They trap some of this heat, keeping the Earth wa
rm enough for us to live.
4. **Balance is Key*x*: This natural process is important because it keeps
our planet at a temperature that's just right for plants, animals, and us
humans! Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be way too cold.

5. *kToo Much of a Good Thing**: But here’s the catch: if we add too many
greenhouse gases (from things like cars, factories, and cutting down tree
s), it makes the blanket too thick. This causes the Earth to warm up too m
uch, leading to climate change. That's why we need to be careful about how
we treat our planet!

So, the greenhouse effect is like having a warm blanket around our Earth,
helping keep it cozy, but we need to make sure it’s not too thick!

Journalist's explanation:
*kUnderstanding the Greenhouse Effect: Nature's Cozy Blanketxx

Imagine stepping outside on a chilly winter day, wrapping yourself in a wa
rm blanket to stave off the cold. This is similar to what our planet exper
iences through a natural phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. While
it plays a crucial role in maintaining life as we know it, understanding i
ts mechanics is key to grasping the challenges our world faces today.

So, what exactly is the greenhouse effect? At its core, it’s a process tha
t helps regulate Earth's temperature, ensuring it’s just right for plants,
animals, and humans. Here’s how it works:

1. **kSunshine and Absorption**: The journey begins with the Sun, which bat
hes our planet in energy. When sunlight reaches Earth, some of it is absor
bed by the land and oceans, warming the surface. Think of this as the Eart
h soaking up warmth like a sponge.

2. *kRadiation Back to Space*x*«: After absorbing this energy, the Earth doe
sn’t keep all the heat. Instead, it radiates some of it back into space in
the form of infrared radiation (a type of heat). It’s like that sponge, on
ce full, starts to release moisture back into the air.

3. **kThe Greenhouse Gases*xx: Here’s where the greenhouse effect truly come
s into play. Our atmosphere is not just empty air; it contains a mix of ga
ses, some of which are known as greenhouse gases—primarily carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor. These gases are like the insulating
layers of your cozy blanket. They trap some of the outgoing infrared radia
tion, preventing it from escaping back into space. This process keeps our
planet warm enough to support life.

4. *kThe Balance*x*: Under natural conditions, this balance is maintained.

The amount of heat entering the atmosphere is roughly equal to the amount

being trapped and radiated back out. This equilibrium has allowed Earth to
maintain a stable climate for thousands of years.

However, human activities—such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestati
on, and industrial processes—have tipped this delicate balance. By releasi
ng additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, we enhance the greenho
use effect, causing more heat to be trapped. This is akin to adding extra
layers to your blanket when you’re already warm; soon, you’re too hot.

The consequences of this intensified greenhouse effect are profound. We ar
e witnessing rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and shifting we
ather patterns, all of which contribute to climate change. These changes c
In [5]:

an lead to severe weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ec
osystems, impacting food security, water supply, and human health.

Understanding the greenhouse effect is crucial not just for grasping clima
te science, but also for motivating action. As we learn more about how our
actions contribute to this phenomenon, it becomes clear that we have the p
ower to influence the outcome. By reducing our carbon footprint—through re
newable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable practices—we can help r
estore balance to our planet’s climate system.

In essence, the greenhouse effect is a reminder of the intricate connectio
ns within our environment. It highlights the delicate balance we must main
tain to ensure that Earth remains a hospitable home for all its inhabitant
s. SO, aS we wrap ourselves in our metaphorical blankets, let’s do so with
mindfulness, ensuring we don’t overdo it and keep our planet’s temperature
just right.

Refining Role Descriptions

Let's explore how to refine role descriptions for more specific outcomes. We'll use a
creative writing example, focusing on different storytelling styles.

storyteller_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["style", "scenario"],
template="""You are a master storyteller known for your ability to a
Your current task is to write in the style of {style}.
Key characteristics of this style include:
1. {style_char1}
2. {style_char2}
3. {style_char3}

Write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) in this style about the foll
{scenario}

Ensure your writing clearly reflects the specified style."
)

styles = [
{
"name": "Gothic horror",
"chari": "Atmospheric and ominous descriptions",
"char2": "Themes of decay, death, and the supernatural",
"char3": "Heightened emotions and sense of dread"
},
{
"name": "Minimalist realism",
"chari": "Sparse, concise language",
"char2": '"Focus on everyday, ordinary events",
"char3": "Subtle implications rather than explicit statements"
}
]
scenario = "A person enters an empty house at twilight"

for style in styles:
chain = storyteller_prompt | llm
response = chain. invoke({
"style": style["name"],

})

print(f'\n{style['name']} version: \n")

print(response.content)

print("-" « 5Q)

Gothic horror version:

As twilight draped its somber veil over the forsaken dwelling, the air thi
ckened with the scent of mold and memories long buried beneath layers of d
ust and despair. The door creaked open with a mournful groan, revealing a
cavernous interior, where shadows danced like specters in the fading ligh
t, whispering secrets of the long-dead inhabitants. Each step echoed omino
usly on the rotting floorboards, a grim reminder of the decay that had cla
imed both structure and spirit, while a chill snaked around the intruder’s
heart, tightening with the realization that they were not alone. In that s
uffocating gloom, the very walls seemed to pulse with a malignant energy,
as if the house itself hungered for a soul to ensnare in its eternal grasp
of sorrow.

Minimalist realism version:

The door creaked as she pushed it open, the sound swallowed by the stillne
ss. Shadows pooled in corners, stretching across the faded floorboards. Sh
e paused, breath caught in the quiet, the air thick with dust and memorie
s. Outside, the sky deepened to indigo, while inside, time seemed to linge
r, waiting.
