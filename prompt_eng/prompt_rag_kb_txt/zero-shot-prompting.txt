Zero-Shot Prompting Tutorial

Overview

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to zero-shot prompting, a
powerful technique in prompt engineering that allows language models to perform
tasks without specific examples or prior training. We'll explore how to design
effective zero-shot prompts and implement strategies using OpenAl's GPT models
and the LangChain library.

Motivation

1. Direct Task Specification

In this section, we'll explore how to craft prompts that clearly define the task without
providing examples. This is the essence of zero-shot prompting.

direct_task_prompt = "Classify the sentiment of the following text as
Do not explain your reasoning, just provide the classification.

Text: {text}
Sentiment:'""'"
direct_task_chain = create_chain(direct_task_prompt)

# Test the direct task specification
texts = [
"T absolutely loved the movie! The acting was superb.",
"The weather today is quite typical for this time of year.",
"I'm disappointed with the service I received at the restaurant."

for text in texts:
result = direct_task_chain. invoke({"text": text}).content
print(f'Text: {text}")
print(f'Sentiment: {result}")

Text: I absolutely loved the movie! The acting was superb.

Sentiment: Positive

Text: The weather today is quite typical for this time of year.
Sentiment: Neutral

Text: I'm disappointed with the service I received at the restaurant.
Sentiment: Negative

2. Format Specification

Providing output format guidelines in the prompt can help structure the Al's response
ina zero-shot scenario.

format_spec_prompt = "Generate a short news article about {topic}.
Structure your response in the following format:

Headline: [A catchy headline for the article]

Lead: [A brief introductory paragraph summarizing the key points]
Body: [2-3 short paragraphs providing more details]

Conclusion: [A concluding sentence or call to action]"""
format_spec_chain = create_chain( format_spec_prompt)

# Test the format specification prompting

topic = "The discovery of a new earth-like exoplanet"

result = format_spec_chain.invoke({"'topic': topic}).content
print( result)

e

*kLead:** In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of astronomers has identif
ied a new Earth-like exoplanet located within the habitable zone of its st
ar, raising hopes for the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Dubbed "Ke
pler—452d,"" the planet orbits a sun-like star approximately 1,40@ light-ye
ars away, offering a tantalizing glimpse into worlds beyond our solar syst
em,

*kBody:** The discovery was made using advanced observational techniques f
rom the Kepler Space Telescope, which has been instrumental in finding tho
usands of exoplanets. Kepler-452d is approximately 1.6 times the size of E
arth and orbits its star at a distance that allows for liquid water to exi
st on its surface—a crucial condition for life as we know it. Scientists b
elieve that the planet's atmosphere could potentially support life, making
it a prime candidate for future exploration.

The research team, led by Dr. Emily Chen, emphasizes the significance of t
his find. "This is one of the most promising Earth-like planets we've disc
overed to date," Chen stated. "The conditions appear to be suitable for li
fe, and with the right tools, we may be able to analyze its atmosphere in
the coming years." As technology advances, the prospect of studying Kepler
-452d and others like it becomes increasingly viable.

*kConclusion:** As we stand on the brink of a new era in space exploratio
n, this exciting discovery fuels the quest to answer one of humanity's mos
t profound questions: Are we alone in the universe?

3. Multi-step Reasoning

For complex tasks, we can break them down into simpler zero-shot steps. This
approach can improve the overall performance of the model.

multi_step_prompt = "Analyze the following text for its main argument,
Provide your analysis in the following steps:

1. Main Argument: Identify and state the primary claim or thesis.
2. Supporting Evidence: List the key points or evidence used to support

2. *kSupporting Evidencexx:

- The production of batteries for electric vehicles involves significan

the electricity used for charging is sourced from fossil fuels.

- Acknowledgment that improvements in renewable energy sources and batt
ery technology could enhance the role of electric vehicles in addressing c
Limate change in the future.

Task: Explain conciesly the concept of blockchain technology

Basic Prompt Result:

Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger system that secure
ly records transactions across multiple computers. It ensures that once da

ticipants. Each block contains a list of transactions and a cryptographic
hash of the previous block, forming a chain. This structure enhances secur
ity, transparency, and trust, as it eliminates the need for a central auth
ority and makes tampering with data extremely difficult. Blockchain is wid
