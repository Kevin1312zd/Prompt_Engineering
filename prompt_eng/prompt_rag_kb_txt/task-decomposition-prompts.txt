Task Decomposition in Prompts Tutorial
Overview
This tutorial explores the concept of task decomposition in prompt engineering,
focusing on techniques for breaking down complex tasks and chaining subtasks in
prompts. These techniques are essential for effectively leveraging large language
models to solve multi-step problems and perform complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation
As AI language models become more advanced, they are increasingly capable of
handling complex tasks. However, these models often perform better when given
clear, step-by-step instructions. Task decomposition is a powerful technique that
allows us to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
This approach not only improves the model's performance but also enhances the
interpretability and reliability of the results.

Key Components
1. Breaking Down Complex Tasks: Techniques for analyzing and dividing complex
problems into simpler subtasks.
2. Chaining Subtasks: Methods for sequentially connecting multiple subtasks to
solve a larger problem.
3. Prompt Design for Subtasks: Crafting effective prompts for each decomposed
subtask.
4. Result Integration: Combining the outputs from individual subtasks to form a
comprehensive solution.

Method Details
The tutorial employs a step-by-step approach to demonstrate task decomposition:
1. Problem Analysis: We start by examining a complex task and identifying its
component parts.
2. Subtask Definition: We define clear, manageable subtasks that collectively
address the main problem.
3. Prompt Engineering: For each subtask, we create targeted prompts that guide
the AI model.
4. Sequential Execution: We implement a chain of prompts, where the output of
one subtask feeds into the next.

5. Result Synthesis: Finally, we combine the outputs from all subtasks to form a
comprehensive solution.
Throughout the tutorial, we use practical examples to illustrate these concepts,
demonstrating how task decomposition can be applied to various domains such as
analysis, problem-solving, and creative tasks.

Conclusion
By the end of this tutorial, learners will have gained practical skills in:
Analyzing complex tasks and breaking them down into manageable subtasks
Designing effective prompts for each subtask
Chaining prompts to guide an AI model through a multi-step reasoning process
Integrating results from multiple subtasks to solve complex problems
These skills will enable more effective use of AI language models for complex
problem-solving and enhance the overall quality and reliability of AI-assisted tasks.

Setup
First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.
In [1]:

import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
def run_prompt(prompt, **kwargs):
"""Helper function to run a prompt through the language model.
Args:
prompt (str): The prompt template string.
**kwargs: Keyword arguments to fill the prompt template.
Returns:
str: The model's response.
"""
prompt_template = PromptTemplate(template=prompt, input_variables=list
chain = prompt_template | llm
return chain.invoke(kwargs).content

Breaking Down Complex Tasks
Let's start with a complex task and break it down into subtasks. We'll use the
example of analyzing a company's financial health.
In [3]:

complex_task = """
Analyze the financial health of a company based on the following data:
- Revenue: $10 million
- Net Income: $2 million
- Total Assets: $15 million
- Total Liabilities: $7 million
- Cash Flow from Operations: $3 million
"""
decomposition_prompt = """
Break down the task of analyzing a company's financial health into 3 subtasks.
Task: {task}
Subtasks:

"""
subtasks = run_prompt(decomposition_prompt, task=complex_task)
print(subtasks)
### Subtask 1: Assess Profitability
**Description:** Evaluate the company's profitability by analyzing key met
rics such as profit margins and return on assets (ROA). This will involve
calculating the net profit margin (Net Income / Revenue) and ROA (Net Inco
me / Total Assets). The objective is to determine how effectively the comp
any converts revenue into profit and how well it utilizes its assets to ge
nerate income.
### Subtask 2: Evaluate Liquidity and Solvency
**Description:** Analyze the company's liquidity and solvency by calculati
ng the current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio. The current ratio can be de
rived from the company's cash flow from operations and total liabilities,
while the debt-to-equity ratio (Total Liabilities / (Total Assets - Total
Liabilities)) will provide insight into the company's financial leverage.
This subtask aims to assess the company's ability to meet short-term oblig
ations and understand the level of debt relative to equity.
### Subtask 3: Examine Cash Flow Health
**Description:** Review the company's cash flow from operations to determi
ne its ability to generate cash from core business activities. This includ
es analyzing the cash flow margin (Cash Flow from Operations / Revenue) an
d comparing it to net income to assess the quality of earnings. The goal i
s to understand how well the company is managing its cash flow and whether
it can sustain operations and fund growth without relying heavily on exter
nal financing.

Chaining Subtasks in Prompts
Now that we have our subtasks, let's create individual prompts for each and chain
them together.

# Run the chained subtasks
profitability_analysis = analyze_profitability(10, 2)
liquidity_analysis = analyze_liquidity(15, 7)
cash_flow_analysis = analyze_cash_flow(3)

Profitability Analysis:
To analyze the company's profitability, we can calculate the profit margi
n using the provided data. The profit margin is a financial metric that in
dicates the percentage of revenue that has turned into profit. It is calcu
lated using the following formula:
\[
\text{Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \ri
ght) \times 100
\]
Given the values:
- Revenue = $10 million
- Net Income = $2 million
Now, substituting the values into the formula:
\[
\text{Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{2,000,000}{10,000,000} \right) \times
100
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Profit Margin} = \left( 0.2 \right) \times 100 = 20\%
\]
### Analysis of the Company's Profitability
A profit margin of 20% indicates that the company retains $0.20 as profit
for every dollar of revenue generated. This is generally considered a stro
ng profit margin, suggesting that the company is effectively managing its
costs relative to its revenue.
Here are some key points to consider regarding the company's profitability
based on this profit margin:
1. **Operational Efficiency**: A profit margin of 20% suggests that the co
mpany may have good control over its operating expenses, which can include
costs related to production, marketing, and administration.
2. **Industry Comparison**: To further assess profitability, it would be b
eneficial to compare this profit margin with industry averages. If the ind
ustry average is lower, it indicates that the company is performing well c
ompared to its peers.
3. **Sustainability**: While a 20% profit margin is strong, it is essentia
l to consider whether this level of profitability is sustainable in the lo
ng term. Factors such as competitive pressures, changes in consumer deman
d, and cost fluctuations can all impact future profitability.
4. **Growth Potential**: The company should also evaluate how it can lever
age its profitability for growth. This could involve reinvesting profits i
nto new products, market expansion, or improving operational efficiencies.

In conclusion, the company's 20% profit margin reflects a solid profitabil
ity position, but continuous monitoring and strategic planning will be cri
tical to maintaining and enhancing this performance.
Liquidity Analysis:
To analyze the company's liquidity, we can start by calculating the curre
nt ratio. The current ratio is a financial metric that measures a company'
s ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
However, since we don't have the specific values for current assets and cu
rrent liabilities, we can derive some insights from the total assets and t
otal liabilities provided.
### Given Data:
- Total Assets: $15 million
- Total Liabilities: $7 million
### Current Ratio Calculation:
The current ratio is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilit
ies}}
\]
Since we do not have the specific values for current assets or current lia
bilities, we can instead focus on total assets and total liabilities to ge
t a sense of the company's overall financial health.
### Analysis of Liquidity:
1. **Debt-to-Asset Ratio**: This can provide insight into the proportion o
f the company's assets that are financed by liabilities.
\[
\text{Debt-to-Asset Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Tota
l Assets}} = \frac{7 \text{ million}}{15 \text{ million}} \approx 0.467
\]
This indicates that about 46.7% of the company's assets are financed th
rough debt, which is a reasonable level but suggests that the company does
carry some risk associated with its liabilities.
2. **Equity Position**: To assess the company's equity position, we can ca
lculate total equity:
\[
\text{Total Equity} = \text{Total Assets} - \text{Total Liabilities} =
15 \text{ million} - 7 \text{ million} = 8 \text{ million}
\]
This suggests that the company has a solid equity base of $8 million, w
hich indicates a relatively stable financial position.
### Conclusion:
While we lack specific current asset and current liability figures to comp
ute the current ratio directly, the company's total assets and liabilities
suggest a favorable liquidity position overall. With 46.7% of its assets f
inanced by liabilities and a healthy equity cushion, the company appears t
o be in a good position to meet its obligations.
For a more detailed liquidity analysis, it would be beneficial to obtain t
he current assets and current liabilities figures to calculate the current
ratio directly. However, based on the available data, the company does not
seem to be in immediate liquidity distress.

Cash Flow Analysis:
Based on the provided data, the company has a cash flow from operations o
f $3 million. Here's a brief analysis of its cash flow health:
1. **Positive Cash Flow from Operations**: A cash flow of $3 million indic
ates that the company is generating sufficient cash from its core business
activities. This is a positive sign, as it suggests that the company is ab
le to cover its operating expenses and potentially reinvest in growth oppo
rtunities.
2. **Sustainability**: If this cash flow figure is consistent over time, i
t could indicate a healthy and sustainable business model. Consistency in
cash flow from operations is essential for long-term stability.
3. **Comparison to Cash Needs**: To fully assess the cash flow health, it
would be important to compare this figure against the company's cash needs
for capital expenditures, debt servicing, and other financial obligations.
If the cash flow from operations exceeds these needs, the company may be i
n a strong position.
4. **Operational Efficiency**: A strong operational cash flow can point to
effective management and operational efficiency. It might be beneficial to
analyze further metrics, such as operating margins and revenue growth, to
gain deeper insights into operational performance.
5. **Room for Improvement**: If the company has significant investments or
is in a growth phase, it may need to evaluate whether $3 million is suffic
ient to support its strategic goals. Additionally, assessing cash flow tre
nds over multiple periods could provide insights into potential weaknesses
or opportunities.
In summary, while a $3 million cash flow from operations is a positive ind
icator, a comprehensive evaluation against the company's financial obligat
ions and historical performance is necessary to fully understand its cash
flow health.

Integrating Results
Finally, let's integrate the results from our subtasks to provide an overall analysis of
the company's financial health.

### Overall Assessment of the Company's Financial Health
Based on the analyses of profitability, liquidity, and cash flow, here are
the key points and an overall evaluation of the company's financial positi
on:
#### Profitability Analysis
- **Profit Margin**: The company has a profit margin of 20%, indicating th
at it retains $0.20 as profit for every dollar of revenue. This is general
ly considered a strong performance.
- **Operational Efficiency**: The profit margin suggests effective managem
ent of operating expenses, positioning the company favorably within its in
dustry.
- **Sustainability Considerations**: While the current margin is robust, o
ngoing monitoring is necessary to ensure that it remains sustainable amids
t market fluctuations and competitive pressures.
#### Liquidity Analysis
- **Debt-to-Asset Ratio**: At approximately 46.7%, this ratio indicates th
at nearly half of the company's assets are financed through debt. This lev
el is manageable but does suggest some risk exposure due to reliance on bo
rrowed capital.
- **Total Equity**: The company has a solid equity base of $8 million, whi
ch provides a cushion against liabilities and enhances financial stabilit
y.
- **Current Ratio**: While the exact current ratio could not be computed d
ue to a lack of specific current assets and current liabilities data, the
overall debt management indicates that the company is not in immediate liq
uidity distress.
#### Cash Flow Analysis
- **Cash Flow from Operations**: A positive cash flow of $3 million from o
perations suggests that the company is generating adequate cash from its c
ore business activities, which is essential for covering operating expense
s and potential reinvestment.
- **Sustainability and Comparisons**: Consistency in this cash flow figure
over time would be crucial for long-term stability. Further analysis again
st the company's cash needs and historical performance could provide deepe
r insights.
### Overall Evaluation
The company presents a **favorable financial position** characterized by s
trong profitability, manageable liquidity levels, and positive operational
cash flow. Here are the overall takeaways:
1. **Strengths**: The 20% profit margin reflects effective cost management

and operational efficiency. Additionally, a solid equity position indicate
s a stable financial foundation.
2. **Risks**: The reliance on debt financing (46.7% debt-to-assets) poses
some risk, highlighting the importance of effective debt management and mo
nitoring of interest obligations.
3. **Opportunities**: The positive cash flow from operations provides the
company with the ability to reinvest in growth and respond to market oppor
tunities.
4. **Recommendations**: Continuous monitoring of profitability, liquidity
ratios, and cash flow trends is essential. Additionally, obtaining detaile
d current asset and liability data would enhance liquidity analysis and al
low for a more comprehensive financial assessment.
In conclusion, while the company is currently in a good financial positio
n, ongoing strategic planning and risk management will be vital to sustain
ing its performance and navigating potential future challenges.
