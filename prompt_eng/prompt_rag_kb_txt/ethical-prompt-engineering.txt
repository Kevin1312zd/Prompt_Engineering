Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv( 'OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

def get_model_response(prompt) :
"""Helper function to get model response."""
return Ulm. invoke(prompt) .content

Understanding Biases in Al

Let's start by examining how biases can manifest in Al responses. We'll use a
potentially biased prompt and analyze the output.

biased_prompt = "Describe a typical programmer."
biased_response = get_model_response(biased_prompt)
print("Potentially biased response:")
print(biased_response)
In [9]:

Potentially biased response:

A typical programmer is someone who is highly analytical, detail-oriented,
and logical. They are skilled in computer programming languages and have a
strong understanding of algorithms and data structures. They are often pas
sionate about problem-solving and enjoy working on complex technical chall
enges. Programmers are also typically self-motivated and enjoy learning ne
w technologies to stay up-to-date in their field. They may work independen
tly or as part of a team, collaborating with others to develop software so
lutions for a variety of industries and applications.

Identifying and Mitigating Biases

Now, let's create a more inclusive prompt and compare the results.

inclusive_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["profession"],
template="Describe the diverse range of individuals who work as {pro

)

inclusive_response = (inclusive_prompt | 1lm).invoke({"profession": "com
print("More inclusive response:")
print(inclusive_response)

More inclusive response:

Computer programmers come from a wide range of backgrounds and bring diver
se experiences and characteristics to their work. Some programmers have fo
rmal education in computer science or related fields, while others are sel
f-taught or have learned through online courses and bootcamps.

In terms of their backgrounds, programmers may come from various industrie
s such as finance, healthcare, education, or entertainment, bringing with
them domain knowledge that can be valuable in developing software for thos
e specific sectors. Some programmers may have a background in mathematics
or engineering, while others may have studied liberal arts or social scien
ces before transitioning to a career in programming.

In terms of their experiences, programmers may have worked in different ro
les before becoming programmers, such as project management, quality assur
ance, or technical support. This diverse experience can bring a unique per
spective to their programming work and help them understand the needs of d
ifferent stakeholders.

In terms of their characteristics, programmers may have a wide range of pe
rsonalities and communication styles. Some may be more introverted and pre
fer to work independently, while others may be more extroverted and thrive
in collaborative team environments. Some programmers may be highly analyti
cal and detail-oriented, while others may be more creative and innovative
in their approach to problem-solving.

Overall, the diverse range of individuals who work as computer programmers
brings a richness of perspectives and skills to the field, making it a dyn
amic and exciting profession to be a part of.

Creating Inclusive Prompts

Let's explore techniques for creating prompts that encourage diverse and inclusive
In [10]:

responses.

def create_inclusive_prompt(topic) :
"""Creates an inclusive prompt template for a given topic."
return PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["topic"],
template="Provide a balanced and inclusive perspective on {topic

)
topics = ["leadership", "family structures", "beauty standards"]

for topic in topics:
prompt = create_inclusive_prompt( topic)
response = (prompt | 1lm).invoke({"topic": topic}).content
print(f'Inclusive perspective on {topic}:")
print( response)
print("\n" + "_My5@ + "\n")

Inclusive perspective on leadership:

Leadership is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be approached fr
om a variety of perspectives, each offering valuable insights into what ma
kes a successful leader. It is important to recognize the diversity of vie
wpoints, experiences, and cultural contexts that shape our understanding o
f leadership, and to consider these factors when examining different leade
rship styles and approaches.

One perspective on leadership is that of transformational leadership, whic
h emphasizes the importance of inspiring and motivating followers to achie
ve a common goal. Transformational leaders are often seen as visionary and
charismatic, able to articulate a compelling vision and inspire others to

work towards it. This approach to leadership can be particularly effective
in times of change or uncertainty, as it encourages followers to embrace n
ew ideas and ways of working.

Another perspective on leadership is that of servant leadership, which foc
uses on the leader's role in serving the needs of their followers. Servant
leaders prioritize the well-being and development of their team members, a
nd see themselves as stewards of their organization's resources and missio
n. This approach to leadership can foster a sense of trust and loyalty amo
ng followers, and create a supportive and inclusive organizational cultur
e.

In addition to these perspectives, it is important to consider the impact

of diverse experiences and cultural contexts on leadership. Different cult
ural norms and values can shape how leadership is perceived and practiced,
and leaders must be sensitive to these differences in order to be effectiv
e. For example, in some cultures, a more hierarchical leadership style may
be expected, while in others, a more collaborative and participative appro
ach may be preferred.

Ultimately, a balanced and inclusive perspective on leadership recognizes
that there is no one-size-fits—all approach to leading others. Leaders mus
t be able to adapt their style to meet the needs of their team and organiz
ation, and be open to learning from diverse viewpoints and experiences. By
embracing this diversity, leaders can create a more inclusive and effectiv
e work environment, where all team members feel valued and empowered to co
ntribute to the organization's success.
Inclusive perspective on family structures:

Family structures vary greatly across different cultures and societies, an
d it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of family arrange
ments that exist. In some cultures, the nuclear family consisting of paren
ts and children is the norm, while in others, extended families or communa
l living arrangements are more common. Additionally, there are families he
aded by single parents, same-sex couples, or individuals who have chosen n
ot to have children.

It is essential to acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-—all definiti
on of what constitutes a family. Families come in all shapes and sizes, an
d what matters most is the love, support, and care that individuals provid
e for each other. Family is about the bonds that connect people, rather th
an a specific set of roles or relationships.

It is also important to recognize that family structures can change over t
ime and that individuals may have multiple families throughout their live
s. Divorce, remarriage, adoption, and other life events can all impact the
composition of a family. It is crucial to support and validate the experie
nces of individuals who may not have traditional family structures, as the
ir relationships are just as valid and meaningful.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to create a sense of belonging, lo
ve, and support within a family, regardless of its structure. By embracing
diversity and inclusivity in our understanding of family, we can create a
more compassionate and accepting society for all individuals.

Inclusive perspective on beauty standards:

Beauty standards are a complex and multifaceted aspect of society that var
y greatly across cultures, regions, and individuals. While some may argue
that beauty standards are arbitrary and superficial, others believe that t
hey play a significant role in shaping societal norms and individual self-
esteem.

On one hand, beauty standards can be seen as harmful and exclusionary, pro
moting a narrow and unrealistic ideal of beauty that can be damaging to th
ose who do not fit that mold. This can lead to body image issues, low self
-esteem, and even mental health struggles for individuals who feel pressur
ed to conform to these standards. Additionally, beauty standards can perpe
tuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination, particularly against margina
lized groups who do not fit the dominant beauty ideal.

On the other hand, beauty standards can also be viewed as a form of cultur
al expression and identity. Different cultures have their own unique beaut
y ideals that reflect their values, traditions, and history. Embracing div
erse beauty standards can promote inclusivity and celebrate the beauty of
all individuals, regardless of their appearance. Beauty standards can also
serve as a form of self-expression and creativity, allowing individuals to
explore and celebrate their unique features and personal style.

It is important to recognize the complexity and diversity of beauty standa
rds, and to challenge narrow and exclusionary ideals that can harm individ
uals and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. By promoting inclusivity, diversi
ty, and self-acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and accepting soci
ety that celebrates the beauty of all individuals, regardless of their app
earance. Beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, colors, and forms, and it is i
mportant to embrace and celebrate this diversity in all its forms.

Evaluating Fairness in Al Outputs

Now, let's implement a simple method to evaluate the fairness of Al-generated
outputs.

def evaluate_fairness(text):
"""Fvaluates the fairness of a given text."
evaluation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["text"],
template="Evaluate the following text for fairness and inclusivi
)

return (evaluation_prompt | 1llm).invoke({"text': text}).content

# Example usage

sample_text = "In the corporate world, strong leaders are often characte
fairness_evaluation = evaluate_fairness(sample_text)

print("Fairness Evaluation:")

print(fairness_evaluation)

Fairness Evaluation:

This text may be biased towards a certain type of leadership style that va
lues decisiveness and command. It could potentially exclude leaders who de
monstrate other traits such as empathy, collaboration, or inclusivity. The
language used may also imply a more traditional and hierarchical view of 1
eadership. Overall, the text could be more inclusive by acknowledging a wi
der range of leadership qualities and styles.

Fairness score: 5

Furthermore, the ideal candidate should have a strong work ethic, determin
ation, and resilience to overcome challenges and setbacks. They should be
able to think strategically and creatively to find solutions to complex pr
oblems and drive the company forward towards success.

Overall, the ideal candidate for a high-stress executive position should h
ave a combination of leadership, communication, organization, and problem-
solving skills, as well as the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and high-
pressure environment.

Improved prompt:

Describe a range of qualities and skills that could make someone successfu
Ll in a high-stress executive position, considering diverse backgrounds, ex
periences, and leadership styles. Emphasize the importance of work-life ba
lance and mental health.

Improved response:

Success in a high-stress executive position requires a diverse range of qu
alities and skills that can be cultivated through various backgrounds, exp
eriences, and leadership styles. Some key attributes that can contribute t
o success in such a role include:

1. Resilience: The ability to bounce back from setbacks and challenges is
crucial in a high-stress executive position. Being able to maintain a posi
tive attitude and approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset can h
elp navigate difficult situations effectively.

2. Emotional intelligence: Understanding and managing one's own emotions,
as well as being able to empathize with others, is essential in building s
trong relationships and effective communication in a high-stress environme
nt.

3. Adaptability: The ability to quickly adjust to changing circumstances a
nd make decisions under pressure is critical in an executive role. Being a
ble to pivot and change course when necessary can help navigate unexpected
challenges and opportunities.

4. Strategic thinking: Having a clear vision and long-term goals, as well
as the ability to develop and execute strategic plans, is important in dri
ving the success of a high-stress executive position. Being able to think
critically and analytically can help make informed decisions that align wi
th organizational objectives.

5. Communication skills: Effective communication is key in any leadership
role, but especially in a high-stress executive position where clear and c
oncise communication is essential for managing teams, stakeholders, and ex
ternal partners.

6. Time management: Being able to prioritize tasks, delegate responsibilit
ies, and manage one's time effectively is crucial in managing the demands
of a high-stress executive position. Setting boundaries and creating a hea
lthy work-life balance is important for maintaining mental health and over
all well-being.

7. Self-care: Prioritizing self-care, such as exercise, healthy eating, an
d mindfulness practices, can help maintain mental health and prevent burno
ut in a high-stress executive role. Taking time for oneself and engaging i
n activities outside of work can help recharge and refocus, ultimately lea
ding to better decision-making and overall success.

In conclusion, success in a high-stress executive position requires a comb
ination of qualities and skills that can be developed through diverse back
grounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Emphasizing the importance of
work-life balance and mental health is essential in maintaining well-being
and long-term success in such a demanding role.

Fairness evaluation of improved response:

This text is fairly inclusive and fair in its content. It emphasizes a ran
ge of qualities and skills needed for success in an executive position, wi
thout specifying any particular gender, race, or other demographic charact
eristic. The mention of prioritizing work-life balance and mental health a
lso adds a layer of inclusivity, acknowledging the importance of self-care
for all individuals in high-stress roles.

However, one potential bias in the text could be the assumption that all i
ndividuals in executive positions face the same level of stress and challe
nges. It may not account for additional barriers that individuals from mar
ginalized backgrounds may face in these roles.

Fairness Score: 8.5
