Basic Prompt Structures Tutorial

Overview

This tutorial focuses on two fundamental types of prompt structures:

1. Single-turn prompts
2. Multi-turn prompts (conversations)

We'll use OpenAl's GPT model and LangChain to demonstrate these concepts.

Motivation

Understanding different prompt structures is crucial for effective communication with
Al models. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, straightforward queries, while
multi-turn prompts enable more complex, context-aware interactions. Mastering
these structures allows for more versatile and effective use of Alin various
applications.

Key Components

1. Single-turn Prompts: One-shot interactions with the language model.
2. Multi-turn Prompts: Series of interactions that maintain context.

3. Prompt Templates: Reusable structures for consistent prompting.

4. Conversation Chains: Maintaining context across multiple interactions.

Method Details

We'll use a combination of OpenAl's API and LangChain library to demonstrate these
prompt structures. The tutorial will include practical examples and comparisons of
different prompt types.

Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

import os

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
In [3]:

In [4]:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY'] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') # OpenAI APT
# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI (model="gpt-40-mini")

1. Single-turn Prompts

Single-turn prompts are one-shot interactions with the language model. They consist
of a single input (prompt) and generate a single output (response).

single_turn_prompt = "What are the three primary colors?"
print(11m. invoke(single_turn_prompt) .content)

The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow. These colors cannot be
created by mixing other colors together and are the foundation for creatin
g a wide range of other colors through mixing. In the context of additive
color mixing (like with light), the primary colors are red, green, and blu
e (RGB).

Now, let's use a PromptTemplate to create a more structured single-turn prompt:

structured_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["topic"],

template="Provide a brief explanation of {topic} and list its three
)

chain = structured_prompt | llm
print(chain.invoke({"topic": "color theory"}).content)

Color theory is a framework used to understand how colors interact, comple
ment each other, and can be combined to create various visual effects. It
is essential in fields such as art, design, and photography, helping artis
ts and designers make informed choices about color usage to evoke emotion
s, communicate messages, and create harmony in their work.

The three main components of color theory are:

1. *kColor Wheelx*: A circular diagram that shows the relationships betwee
n colors. It typically includes primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, p
roviding a visual representation of how colors can be combined.

2. **Color Harmony**: The concept of combining colors in a pleasing way. I
t involves using color schemes such as complementary, analogous, and triad
ic to create balance and visual interest.

3. **kColor Context**: This refers to how colors interact with one another
and how they can change perception based on their surrounding colors. The
same color can appear different depending on the colors next to it, which
influences mood and interpretation.

2. Multi-turn Prompts (Conversations)
In [5]:

Multi-turn prompts involve a series of interactions with the language model, allowing
for more complex and context-aware conversations.

conversation = ConversationChain(
LLm=11m,
verbose=True,
memory=ConversationBufferMemory ( )

)

print(conversation.predict(input="Hi, I'm learning about space. Can you
print(conversation.predict(input="What's the largest planet in our solar
print(conversation.predict(input="How does its size compare to Earth?"))

Prompt after formatting:

The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI
is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If th
e AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does no
t know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi, I'm learning about space. Can you tell me about planets?
AI:

> Finished chain.

Absolutely! Planets are fascinating celestial bodies that orbit stars, and
in our solar system, they revolve around the Sun. There are eight recogniz
ed planets in our solar system, and they can be categorized into two main
groups: terrestrial planets and gas giants.

The terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and have
solid surfaces.

- *kMercury*x* is the closest planet to the Sun and has extreme temperature
variations, ranging from scorching hot during the day to frigid cold at ni
ght.

- *kVenus**k is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar siz
e but has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest
planet in the solar system.

- *kEarthek, our home, is unique for its liquid water and life-sustaining
atmosphere.

-— *kMars**, Known as the Red Planet because of its iron oxide-rich soil, h
as the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system.

The gas giants—Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants—Uranus and Neptune,
are much larger and do not have solid surfaces like the terrestrial planet
S.

- *kJupiterx* is the largest planet, famous for its Great Red Spot, a mass
ive storm larger than Earth, and its many moons, including the largest moo
n in the solar system, Ganymede.

— *kSaturn** is known for its stunning ring system, made up of ice and roc
k particles.

- *kUranus** is unique because it rotates on its side, and it's known for
its blue color due to methane in its atmosphere.

- *kNeptunexx, the furthest planet from the Sun, has strong winds and is a
lso blue due to methane; it has the fastest winds recorded in the solar sy
stem.

Human: What's the Largest planet in our solar system?

AI: The largest planet in our solar system is **Jupiterx*. It has a diamet
er of about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers) and is more than 11 times wi
der than Earth! Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and

it has a very strong magnetic field and numerous moons—over 79 have been c
onfirmed, with the four largest known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, G
anymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is particularly notable as it is not only

the Largest moon of Jupiter but also the Largest moon in the entire solar

system, even larger than the planet Mercury! If you want to know more abou
t Jupiter or any of its moons, just let me know!

Human: How does its size compare to Earth?

AI:

> Finished chain.

Jupiter is significantly larger than Earth! To give you a clearer picture,
Jupiter's diameter is about 86,881 miles (139,822 kilometers), while Eart
h's diameter is around 7,917.5 miles (12,742 kilometers). This means that
Jupiter is more than 11 times wider than Earth!

In terms of volume, you could fit about 1,300 Earths inside Jupiter! Addit
ionally, Jupiter's mass is approximately 318 times greater than that of Ea
rth. Despite its massive size and weight, Jupiter has a much lower density
compared to Earth, which is why it is classified as a gas giant. If you ha
ve more questions about Jupiter or want to know how gravity differs betwee
n the two planets, feel free to ask!

Let's compare how single-turn and multi-turn prompts handle a series of related
questions:

# Single-turn prompts
prompts = [
"What is the capital of France?",
"What is its population?",
"What is the city's most famous landmark?"

]

print("Single-turn responses:")
for prompt in prompts:
print(f"Q: {prompt}")
print(f"A: {1l1m.invoke( prompt) .content}\n")

# Multi-turn prompts
print("Multi-turn responses:")
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=1llm, memory=ConversationBufferMemor
for prompt in prompts:
print(f"Q: {prompt}")
print(f"A: {conversation.predict(input=prompt) }\n")
Single-turn responses:
Q: What is the capital of France?
A: The capital of France is Paris.

Q: What is its population?
A: Could you please specify which location or entity you are referring to
in order to provide the population information?

Q: What is the city's most famous landmark?

A: To provide an accurate answer, I need to know which city you are referr
ing to. Different cities have different famous landmarks. Could you please
specify the city?

Multi-turn responses:

Q: What is the capital of France?

A: The capital of France is Paris! It's known for its iconic landmarks suc
h as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris
is also famous for its rich history, art, and culture. Have you ever been
to Paris or is it on your travel list?

Q: What is its population?

A: As of my last update, the population of Paris is approximately 2.1 mill
ion people within the city limits. However, if you consider the larger met
ropolitan area, that number rises to around 12 million. Paris is a vibrant
city with a diverse population and a mix of cultures. Have you ever though
t about what it would be like to live in such a bustling city?

Q: What is the city's most famous landmark?

A: The most famous landmark in Paris is undoubtedly the Eiffel Tower! It w
as completed in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) and sta
nds at a height of about 30@ meters (984 feet). The Eiffel Tower attracts
millions of visitors each year, offering stunning views of the city from i
ts observation decks. It's also beautifully illuminated at night, making i
t a romantic spot for both locals and tourists. Have you ever seen the Eif
fel Tower in pictures or dreamed of visiting it?

Conclusion

This tutorial has introduced you to the basics of single-turn and multi-turn prompt
structures. We've seen how:

1. Single-turn prompts are useful for quick, isolated queries.

2. Multi-turn prompts maintain context across a conversation, allowing for more
complex interactions.

3. PromptTemplates can be used to create structured, reusable prompts.

4. Conversation chains in LangChain help manage context in multi-turn
interactions.

Understanding these different prompt structures allows you to choose the most
appropriate approach for various tasks and create more effective interactions with Al
