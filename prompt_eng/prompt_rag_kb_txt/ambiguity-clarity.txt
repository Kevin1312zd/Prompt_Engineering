By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to identify and
resolve ambiguity in prompts, as well as techniques for crafting clearer prompts.
These skills will enable you to communicate more effectively with Al models, resulting
in more accurate and relevant outputs across various applications.

Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.

import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Load environment variables
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv( 'OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI (model="gpt-40-mini")

Identifying Ambiguous Prompts

Let's start by examining some ambiguous prompts and analyzing their potential
interpretations.

ambiguous_prompts = [
"Tell me about the bank.",
"What's the best way to get to school?",
"Can you explain the theory?"

for prompt in ambiguous_prompts:

analysis_prompt = f"Analyze the following prompt for ambiguity: ‘{pr

print(f'Prompt: {prompt}"')
print(11m. invoke(analysis_prompt) .content)
print("-" * 50)

Prompt: Tell me about the bank.
The prompt "Tell me about the bank." is ambiguous for several reasons:

1. *«*kType of Bank*x: The term "bank'' can refer to different types of finan
cial institutions. It could signify a commercial bank, an investment bank,
a savings bank, or even a central bank (like the Federal Reserve). Each ty
pe has distinct functions, services, and regulatory environments.

2. *«kContext of Inquiry**: The prompt does not specify the context in whic
h the bank is to be discussed. Are we looking for historical information,

current services, financial performance, or perhaps regulatory issues? Dif
ferent contexts would lead to different answers.
3. *kLocation*x«: The prompt does not indicate whether it refers to a speci
fic bank (e.g., Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase) or banks in general. With
out a specified location or institution, the discussion could range from a
local bank to international banking practices.

4. **Aspects of Interest*«: The prompt does not clarify which aspects of t
he bank the speaker is interested in. It could pertain to its services (lo
ans, mortgages, checking accounts), its role in the economy, its history,
recent news, or even customer service experiences.

5. *kAudience Knowledgex*: The prompt does not consider the knowledge leve
Ll of the audience. A detailed explanation about banking might be appropria
te for someone with little understanding of finance, while an overview of
current trends might be desired by someone with more expertise.

### Possible Interpretations:

1. **General Overviewkx: A request for a general description of what a ban
k is and its functions in the economy.

2. *kSpecific Bankkk: Information about a particular bank (e.g., "Tell me

about Chase Bank" or "Tell me about the Bank of England").

3. *kBanking Products**: A focus on the types of products and services off
ered by banks, such as savings accounts, loans, and investment options.

4. *kRegulatory Issues**: An inquiry into the laws and regulations that go
vern banking practices.

5. *kRecent Developments**: An interest in recent news or changes in the b
anking sector, such as mergers, acquisitions, or technological innovation

S.

6. *kHistorical Context**: A discussion about the history and evolution of
banking as a practice.

7. **kPersonal Experiencex*x: A request for personal anecdotes or experience
s related to using a bank.

In conclusion, the ambiguity of the prompt arises from its vagueness in te
rms of context, specificity, and focus, allowing for multiple interpretati
ons that could lead to different discussions about banking.

Prompt: What's the best way to get to school?

The prompt "What's the best way to get to school?" is ambiguous due to sev
eral factors that can lead to different interpretations.

1. **Mode of Transportation**: The phrase "best way" could refer to variou
s modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, driving, taking public
transport, or carpooling. Each mode could be considered the "best" based o
n different criteria (e.g., speed, cost, environmental impact, safety).

2. *«kCriteria for "Best'"*k: The term "best" is subjective and can vary bas
ed on the criteria used. For instance, one might interpret "best" as:
— Fastest route
Cheapest option
- Most environmentally friendly choice
Safest route (considering traffic, road conditions, etc.)
Most convenient (e.g., minimal transfers if using public transport)

3. **Starting Point**: The prompt does not specify where the individual is
starting from. The best route may vary significantly based on the starting
location.

4. *kDestination*x*k: While "school" is mentioned, it is unclear which schoo
l is being referred to, especially if there are multiple schools in the ar
ea or if the individual attends a specific institution with a particular a
ddress.

5. *kTime of Day*xk: The best route may depend on the time of day due to tr
affic patterns, public transportation schedules, or safety considerations
(e.g., walking alone at night).

6. **kPersonal Preferencesxx: Different individuals may have unique prefere
nces or requirements that affect their choice of how to get to school (e.
g., a preference for exercise, avoiding crowded public transport, etc.).

### Possible Interpretations:

1. «Mode of Transport:
- "What’s the fastest way to get to school by car?"
- "What’s the best route for walking to school?"

2. *«kCriteriax*:
- "What’s the cheapest way to get to school?"
- "What’s the safest route to take?"

3. *kStarting Pointxx:
- "What's the best way to get to school from my house?"
- "How do I get to school if I’m coming from downtown?"

4. *kDestination*«:
- "What’s the best way to get to Lincoln High School?"
- "How do I get to the community college from my location?"

5. *kTime of Dayx*«:
- "What’s the best route to school during rush hour?"
- "What time should I leave to avoid traffic?"

6. **kPersonal Preferencesxx:
- "What’s the best way to bike to school?"
- "Is there a public transport option that’s less crowded?"

In summary, the ambiguity in the prompt arises from the multiple interpret
ations of the terms used, the lack of specific context, and the variabilit
y based on individual preferences and circumstances.

Prompt: Can you explain the theory?

The prompt "Can you explain the theory?" is ambiguous for several reasons:

1. *kLack of Context*«k: The term "theory" is vague without additional cont
ext. There are countless theories across various fields, such as science (
e.g., the theory of evolution, quantum theory), philosophy (e.g., social c
ontract theory), psychology (e.g., attachment theory), and many others. Wi
thout specifying which theory is being referred to, the question could be
interpreted in multiple ways.

2. **kAssumed Knowledgex*: The prompt assumes that the respondent knows whi
ch theory is being referenced. Depending on the respondent's background, t
hey may not be familiar with the specific theory in question, leading to c
onfusion.

3. **kDepth of Explanationx*: The term "explain" is also ambiguous. It coul
d imply a brief summary, a detailed analysis, or a layman's explanation. D
ifferent audiences may require different levels of detail, and the respond
ent may not know how comprehensive their explanation should be.

4. **kAudiencexk: The prompt does not specify who the explanation is for. A
n explanation suitable for a novice may differ significantly from one tail
In [3]:

ored for an expert audience.
Possible interpretations of the prompt include:

1. **Specific Theory Request**: The respondent might interpret the questio
n as asking about a specific theory known to both parties, such as "Can yo
u explain the theory of relativity?"

2. **kGeneral Inquiry**: The respondent might consider it a general inquiry
into theories in a particular field (e.g., "Can you explain any psychologi
cal theory?").

3. *kField-Specific Request**x: The respondent could interpret it as a requ
est related to a specific academic discipline (e.g., "Can you explain the
theory of supply and demand in economics?").

4. **kNature of Explanationx*x: The respondent might wonder whether to provi
de a simple definition, a historical overview, or a technical breakdown of
the theory.

5. **kPhilosophical vs. Scientific Theory*x*: The respondent may consider wh
ether the question refers to a scientific theory that is testable and empi
rical or a philosophical theory that may involve more abstract reasoning.

In conclusion, the prompt's ambiguity arises from its lack of specificity
regarding the theory in question, the depth of explanation needed, and the
intended audience. Clarifying these aspects would help eliminate confusion
and facilitate a more productive discussion.

Resolving Ambiguity

Now, let's explore strategies for resolving ambiguity in prompts.

def resolve_ambiguity(prompt, context):

Resolve ambiguity in a prompt by providing additional context.

Args:
prompt (str): The original ambiguous prompt
context (str): Additional context to resolve ambiguity

Returns:

str: The AI's response to the clarified prompt

clarified_prompt = f'{context}\n\nBased on this context, {prompt}"
return Ulm. invoke(clarified_prompt) .content

# Example usage

ambiguous_prompt = "Tell me about the bank."

contexts = [
"You are a financial advisor discussing savings accounts.",
"You are a geographer describing river formations."

]

for context in contexts:
print(f'Context: {context}")
print(f'Clarified response: {resolve_ambiguity(ambiguous_prompt, con
print("-" * 50)

Context: You are a financial advisor discussing savings accounts.
Clarified response: When discussing savings accounts, it's important to co
nsider the role of the bank in managing these accounts. Here are some key
points to understand about banks in this context:

1. **Types of Banks**: Banks can be broadly categorized into commercial ba
nks, credit unions, and online banks. Each type offers savings accounts bu
t may have different terms, interest rates, and services.

2. **kInterest Rates**: Banks typically offer interest on savings accounts,
which can vary widely. Online banks often provide higher interest rates co
mpared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks due to lower overhead costs.
It’s essential to compare rates when choosing a bank for your savings acco
unt.

3. **kFees and Minimum Balances**: Some banks charge monthly maintenance fe
es or require a minimum balance to avoid these fees. It’s crucial to under
stand the fee structure before selecting a bank, as this can affect your o
verall savings.

4. *kFDIC Insurancex*: In the United States, deposits in savings accounts
at member banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (
FDIC) up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank. This insurance provides secu
rity and peace of mind for your savings.

5. *kAccessibility and Conveniencex*: Consider how easy it is to access yo
ur funds. Many banks offer mobile banking apps, ATMs, and online account m
anagement, making it convenient to manage your savings.

6. **kCustomer Servicek*: Good customer service can significantly enhance y
our banking experience. Look for banks that offer support through multiple
channels, such as phone, chat, and in-person assistance.

7. *kPromotions and Offers*x*«: Banks often run promotions for new savings a
ccounts, such as cash bonuses for opening an account or higher introductor
y interest rates. These can be beneficial, but always read the fine print.

8. **kAccount Features**: Some banks provide additional features like autom
atic savings plans, budgeting tools, or the ability to link to other accou
nts for easy transfers. These can help you grow your savings more effectiv
ely.

When choosing a bank for your savings account, it’s important to evaluate
these factors to find the best fit for your financial goals and needs.
Context: You are a geographer describing river formations.

Clarified response: In the context of river formations, the term "bank" re
fers to the land alongside a river. Banks play a crucial role in shaping t
he river's flow and ecosystem. There are typically two banks in a river: t
he left bank and the right bank, determined by the perspective of looking
downstream.

*kCharacteristics of River Banks:*x

1. *kComposition:** River banks can be made up of various materials, inclu
ding soil, sand, silt, gravel, and rocks. The composition can affect erosi
on rates, sediment deposition, and the types of vegetation that can thrive
in the area.
In [4]:

2. *kErosion and Deposition:** The dynamic processes of erosion and deposi
tion significantly shape river banks. Erosion occurs when water flow remov
es material from the bank, often resulting in steep, undercut banks. Conve
rsely, deposition occurs when sediment carried by the river is dropped of

f, usually at points where the water slows down, leading to the formation

of sandbars or point bars.

3. *kEcology:**« River banks are often rich in biodiversity. The vegetation
found along banks, such as reeds, willows, and other riparian plants, prov
ides habitat and food for various wildlife species. These plants also help
stabilize the bank, reduce erosion, and improve water quality by filtering
pollutants.

4. **kHuman Impact:** Human activities, such as urban development, agricult
ure, and dam construction, can significantly alter river banks. These acti
vities may lead to increased erosion, reduced habitat quality, and changes
in sediment transport, which can affect the overall health of the river ec
osystem.

5. *kFloodplain Interaction:** River banks are often part of a larger floo
dplain, which is the area adjacent to the river that may be inundated duri
ng periods of high flow. The interaction between the river and its banks d
uring flooding can lead to the deposition of nutrient-rich sediments, bene
fiting the surrounding ecosystem.

Understanding the formation and dynamics of river banks is essential for m
anaging and preserving riverine environments, as they are integral to the
health of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

- A baking sheet or pizza stone

- A rolling pin (optional)

- A pizza peel (optional, for transferring to the oven)

An oven (preferably with a pizza stone or steel for best results)

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Make the Dough

1. **kMix the dry ingredients**: In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt,
and instant yeast. If you're using sugar, add it here as well.

2. **Add water**: Slowly pour in the warm water while stirring the mixture
with a spoon or your hand until it begins to come together into a shaggy d
ough.

3. *kKnead the dough**: Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface
and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If the dough is
too sticky, sprinkle a little more flour as needed.

4. **kLet it rise: Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly g
reased bowl. Cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap and let it rise in
a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Sauce

1. *kBlend the tomatoes**: In a bowl, crush the canned tomatoes by hand or
use a blender for a smoother consistency. You want it to be a bit chunky f
or texture.

2. *kSeason*x*x: Add a Little salt to taste and a tablespoon of olive oil to
the tomato mixture. Mix well and set aside.

#### Step 3: Preheat the Oven
1. **kPreheat your ovenx*x: If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven and
In [6]:

preheat to the highest setting (usually around 475°F to 5@@°F or 245°C to
260°C) for at least 3@ minutes. If you don’t have a pizza stone, preheat a
baking sheet.

#### Step 4: Shape the Pizza

1. **Divide the dough**: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divid
e it into two equal pieces (for two pizzas). Shape each piece into a ball

and let them rest for 10-15 minutes.

2. *kShape the pizza*x«k: On a Lightly floured surface, take one dough ball

and gently stretch it out with your hands or roll it out with a rolling pi
n into a 1@-12 inch round. Make sure the edges are slightly thicker for th
e crust.

#### Step 5: Assemble the Pizza

1. **Add the sauce*x*: Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the sur
face of the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

2. **Add cheesex*: Tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces and distrib
ute them evenly over the sauce.

3. *kAdd basilx*x: Tear a few fresh basil leaves and sprinkle them on top (
you can also add them after baking for a fresher taste).

4. **Drizzle olive oil**: Drizzle a little olive oil over the top for adde
d flavor.

#### Step 6: Bake the Pizza

1. *kTransfer to the ovenx*: If using a pizza peel, sprinkle it with flour
or cornmeal and carefully transfer the assembled pizza onto it. Then slide
the pizza onto the preheated stone or baking sheet in the oven.

2. *kBakex«: Bake for about 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and
the cheese is bubbling and starting to brown.

3. *kCheck frequently**: Keep an eye on the pizza to avoid burning, especi
ally if your oven runs hot.

#### Step 7: Serve

1. *kRemove from oven*k*: Once done, carefully remove the pizza from the ov
en,

our classic Margherita pizza!

### Tips:

- For the best flavor, use high-quality ingredients, especially the tomato
es and mozzarella.

- If you have time, letting the dough rise slowly in the refrigerator over
night can enhance the flavor and texture.

- Experiment with the thickness of the crust to find your preferred style.

Enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!

Structured Prompts for Clarity

Using structured prompts can significantly improve clarity and consistency in Al
responses.

structured_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["topic", "aspects", "tone'],
template="""Provide an analysis of {topic} considering the following
1. {{aspects[@] }}
2. {{aspects [1] }}
3. {{aspects [2] }}

Present the analysis in a {tone} tone.

)

# Example usage
input_variables = {

"topic": "the impact of social media on society",
"aspects": ["communication patterns", "mental health", "information
"tone": "balanced and objective"

}

chain = structured_prompt | llm
response = chain.invoke(input_variables) .content
print( response)

To analyze the impact of social media on society, we can consider the foll
owing aspects: communication, mental health, and information disseminatio
n. Each of these areas reveals both positive and negative consequences of
social media usage.

### 1. Communication

*kPosSitive Impact: **

Social media has revolutionized communication by making it easier and fast
er for people to connect across long distances. Platforms like Facebook, T
witter, and Instagram allow users to share moments, thoughts, and experien
ces with friends and family, regardless of geographic barriers. This insta
nt connectivity can foster relationships and create a sense of belonging,
especially for those who may feel isolated in their physical environments.

*kNegative Impact: **

Conversely, the nature of communication on social media can lead to misund
erstandings and conflicts. The absence of non-verbal cues, such as tone an
d body language, can result in misinterpretations of messages. Furthermor
e, the prevalence of online arguments and cyberbullying can create a toxic
environment, leading to strained relationships and a decline in face-to-fa
ce interactions.

### 2. Mental Health

*kPosSitive Impact: **

Social media can serve as a supportive platform for individuals dealing wi
th mental health issues. Online communities provide a space for individual
s to share experiences and seek support from others facing similar challen
ges. Many organizations use social media to raise awareness about mental h
ealth, promoting resources and encouraging open discussions.

*kNegative Impact: **

On the flip side, social media can contribute to mental health issues such
as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. The constant comparison with
others' curated lives can lead to feelings of inadequacy. Additionally, th
e addictive nature of social media can exacerbate feelings of loneliness a
nd isolation, as users may substitute online interactions for genuine soci
al connections.

### 3. Information Dissemination
In [8]:

*kPosSitive Impact: **

Social media has democratized the flow of information, allowing users to a
ccess a wide range of news and perspectives that may not be covered by tra
ditional media outlets. This accessibility can empower individuals to enga
ge in social and political discourse, mobilize for causes, and stay inform
ed about global events in real-time.

*kNegative Impact: **

However, the rapid spread of information can also lead to the disseminatio
n of misinformation and disinformation. False narratives can easily go vir
al, leading to public confusion and mistrust in credible sources. The algo
rithms that govern many social media platforms often prioritize sensationa
L content, which can skew public perception and create echo chambers that

reinforce existing biases.

### Conclusion

In summary, the impact of social media on society is multifaceted, encompa
ssing both beneficial and detrimental effects. While it fosters communicat
ion, offers mental health support, and enhances information accessibility,
it also presents challenges such as misunderstandings, mental health conce
rns, and the spread of misinformation. A balanced perspective requires rec
ognizing these complexities and striving for responsible usage of social m
edia to maximize its positive potential while mitigating its adverse effec
ts.

Practical Exercise: Improving Prompt Clarity

Now, let's practice improving the clarity of prompts.

unclear_prompts = [
"What's the difference?",
"How does it work?",
"Why is it important?"

def improve_prompt_clarity(unclear_prompt) :
