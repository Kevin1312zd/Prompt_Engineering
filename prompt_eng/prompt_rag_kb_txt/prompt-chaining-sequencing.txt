Prompt Chaining and Sequencing Tutorial

Overview

This tutorial explores the concepts of prompt chaining and sequencing in the context
of working with large language models. We'll use OpenAl's GPT models and the
LangChain library to demonstrate how to connect multiple prompts and build logical
flows for more complex Al-driven tasks.

Motivation

As Al applications become more sophisticated, there's often a need to break down
complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Prompt chaining and sequencing allow
us to guide language models through a series of interrelated prompts, enabling more
structured and controlled outputs. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that
require multiple stages of processing or decision-making.

Key Components

1. Basic Prompt Chaining: Connecting the output of one prompt to the input of
another.

2. Sequential Prompting: Creating a logical flow of prompts to guide the Al
through a multi-step process.

3. Dynamic Prompt Generation: Using the output of one prompt to dynamically
generate the next prompt.

4. Error Handling and Validation: Implementing checks and balances within the
prompt chain.

Method Details

We'll start by setting up our environment with the necessary libraries. Then, we'll
explore basic prompt chaining by connecting two simple prompts. We'll move on to
more complex sequential prompting, where we'll guide the Al through a multi-step
analysis process. Next, we'll demonstrate how to dynamically generate prompts
based on previous outputs. Finally, we'll implement error handling and validation
techniques to make our prompt chains more robust.

Throughout the tutorial, we'll use practical examples to illustrate these concepts,
such as a multi-step text analysis task and a dynamic question-answering system.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to implement
prompt chaining and sequencing in your Al applications. These techniques will enable
you to tackle more complex tasks, improve the coherence and relevance of Al-
generated content, and create more interactive and dynamic Al-driven experiences.

Setup

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up our environment.

import os
import re

from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv( 'OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI (model="gpt-40-mini")

Basic Prompt Chaining

Let's start with a simple example of prompt chaining. We'll create two prompts: one
to generate a short story, and another to summarize it.

# Define prompt templates
story_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["'genre"],

template="Write a short {genre} story in 3-4 sentences."
)

summary_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["'story"],
template="Summarize the following story in one sentence: \n{story}"

)

# Chain the prompts
def story_chain(genre):
"""Generate a story and its summary based on a given genre.

Args:
genre (str): The genre of the story to generate.

Returns:
tuple: A tuple containing the generated story and its summary.

story = (story_prompt | 1llm).invoke({"genre": genre}).content
In [4]:

summary = (summary_prompt | 1llm).invoke({"story': story}).content
return story, summary

# Test the chain

genre = "science fiction"

story, summary = story_chain(genre)
print(f'Story: {story}\n\nSummary: {summary}")

Story: In the year 2147, humanity discovered a way to communicate with the
ir future selves through time-locked messages sent via quantum entanglemen
t. When Ava received a cryptic warning from her future self, she struggled
to decipher its meaning: "Trust the shadow, not the light." As a solar fla
re threatened to wipe out Earth's power grid, she realized the warning was
about a hidden faction that thrived in the chaos. Embracing the darkness,
Ava united the underground resistance, ensuring that humanity would not ju
st survive, but rise anew from the ashes.

Summary: In 2147, Ava deciphers a cryptic warning from her future self abo
ut a hidden faction amidst a solar flare crisis, leading her to unite an u
nderground resistance that helps humanity not only survive but thrive in t
he chaos.

Sequential Prompting

Now, let's create a more complex sequence of prompts for a multi-step analysis task.
We'll analyze a given text for its main theme, tone, and key takeaways.

# Define prompt templates for each step
theme_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["text"],

template="Identify the main theme of the following text:\n{text}"
)

tone_prompt = PromptTemplate(

input_variables=["text"],

template="Describe the overall tone of the following text:\n{text}"
)

takeaway_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["text", "theme", "tone"],

template="Given the following text with the main theme '{theme}' and
)

def analyze_text(text):
"""'Perform a multi-step analysis of a given text.

Args:
text (str): The text to analyze.

Returns:

dict: A dictionary containing the theme, tone, and key takeaways
theme = (theme_prompt | 1lm).invoke({"text": text}).content
tone = (tone_prompt | 1llm).invoke({"text": text}).content
takeaways = (takeaway_prompt | 1lm)-invoke({"text": text, "theme": t
return {"theme": theme, "tone": tone, "takeaways": takeaways}

# Test the sequential prompting
