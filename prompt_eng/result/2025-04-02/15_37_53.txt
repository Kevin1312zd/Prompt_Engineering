2025-04-02 15:40:57,498 - 15_37_53.txt - INFO - 【 Prompt:  
"Explain how to locate and extract specific material property data from a Material Card (e.g., MAT1, MAT2) in an MSC Nastran BDF file. Include:  
1. Identification criteria (material ID, card type, or specific properties like E/G/RHO)  
2. Required BDF syntax patterns  
3. Example workflow for querying nonlinear material parameters  
4. Tools/commands (e.g., Python regex, NASTRAN parser libraries)  
5. Error handling for legacy formats  
Provide a sample solution for finding all MAT3 cards with temperature-dependent properties in a multi-step analysis."  

**Rationale**:  
1. **Specificity Framework**: Forces explicit addressing of BDF syntax, material types, and extraction methods  
2. **Example-Driven**: Anchors the technical response with concrete use cases  
3. **Layered Query**: Separates identification/parsing/validation tasks using Bloom's Taxonomy  
4. **Error Anticipation**: Explicitly requests boundary-case handling for real-world files  
5. **Toolchain Context**: Bridges between file inspection and programmatic implementation  

This structure aligns with finite element analysis workflows while preventing ambiguous interpretations of "query" (manual inspection vs automated extraction). 】

2025-04-02 15:40:57,507 - 15_37_53.txt - INFO - 【 Prompt:  
"Context: You are working with an MSC Nastran Bulk Data File (BDF) containing finite element model definitions. Your task is to locate and interpret material property definitions.  

Query: Provide a step-by-step method to:  
1. Identify the specific material card (e.g., MAT1, MAT2, MAT9) by material ID or name  
2. Extract its full parameter set (elastic modulus, density, etc.)  
3. Handle duplicate material IDs if present  

Include an example BDF snippet showing a MAT1 card with ID 101 and explain how to parse its components.  
Additional Considerations:  
- Address how to verify material card validity  
- Mention common pitfalls when querying legacy BDF formats"  

This prompt combines specificity (material types, ID example), structural clarity (numbered steps), and error-aware design (duplicates, legacy formats). It uses the "chunking" technique to break the task into logical components and incorporates anti-goals by explicitly addressing potential pitfalls. 】
